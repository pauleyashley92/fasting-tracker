A Mobile app build in React Native to track intermittent fasting. 

Project Premise

All of us know if we are focused on healthy eating we need to think about what we eat, but what about WHEN we eat? During my recent fitness journey, I have been on a mission to change my relationship with food. This has involved not only changing my daily eating habit to include healthy whole foods but also to have boundaries around when I eat. This is an application to help track intermittent fasting schedule so you too can stay on track with your fitness journey and live your best life.
